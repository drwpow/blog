**In 2019, a revolution happened in JS.** You may have missed it. All [major browsers][esm-browser]
and [Node.js][esm-node] added native support for ES Modules (ESM)—no Babel, transpiling,
preprocessing, or trickery needed.

If you’ve written JavaScript in the time before React & webpack, you remember how much of a mess it
was without `import` or `require()`. You had to be intimately familiar with `this` and lexical
scoping, otherwise it’d come back to bite you. Vendor scripts weren’t a thing, unless they were
completely isolated from the rest of your JS (and God help you if it there was a bug, and it
wasn’t). Put plainly, global JS was a nightmare to write software for. Much of JavaScript’s bad rep
in the programming world came from that time. And it was partly justified—JavaScript lacked many
things a mature programming language did, chiefly of all, a module system.

That changed in 2019, when the ESM proposal became a reality, not something that only lived in the
make-believe world of webpack & Babel. JavaScript _finally_ got the thing everyone had been asking
for.

So why didn’t more people notice?

## the land of make-believe

In preparing [for a talk I gave][pika-web] last year, I realized just how much JS has changed over
the last decade. Node.js was released in 2010 with the CommonJS module system, and as a result, npm.
That’s over 10 years of CommonJS we’ve been writing, and we’re not slowing down there (if this is
all mumbo-jumbo to you, hopefully [my talk][pika-web] will help).

In the land of Node, we got Gulp, Grunt, Babel, webpack, Browserify, and Rollup. These are all tools
that fundamentally changed how we wrote JS. And they all, in their own unique ways, compensated for
JS’ lack of a module system. Gulp and Grunt gave you more tools to invent your own bundle, whereas
Browserify and webpack embraced the idea of a JS module system by completely simulating it, and
abstracting it away from you. Babel made everything possible.

But the point is: all of these tools over the past 10 years created a land of make-believe that JS
itself (or browsers) didn’t support. This wasn’t a bad thing, as it let us code more, faster, and we
got to stress-test the future before actually arriving—all good things.

But now we don’t need it anymore, and it’s hard to change everything and start over again. And
perhaps that fear of starting over—again—has kept us from recognizing the exciting new future. Yet
we must move forward.

## why switch to ESM

So, why switch to ESM? What do we stand to gain by changing everything?

### universal

Universal JS means the same JavaScript works in a browser and the server. Remember that Node.js is
truly a different language from clientside JS, but with ESM that would no longer need to be the
case.

### remote imports

This is _huge_. We can import any module from anywhere on the internet, and **are no longer bound to
npm.** Consider [Deno][deno], a new V8/Rust/Tokio runtime that might replace Node.js. This is a line
from the [docs][deno-docs]:

> **Comparison to Node.js**<br/> Deno does not use `npm`

This single, understated line is a huge shift. How can you just… _move away_ from the most popular
package repository in history? With ESM, it’s possible 🎉

### no bundling or transpilation needed

Imagine a world where you don’t need to run any CLI command whatsoever to start a front-end
application. No runtime, webpack, build times… _nothing_.

To learn more about this, check out _[A future without webpack][pika-webpack]_.

### near-perfect caching

Thanks to the “remote imports” story above, in addition to being freed from npm, there’s another
benefit: _near-perfect caching._ In the webpack world before ESM, you always had to make trade-offs:
rolling everything into one giant bundle meant no load times after initializing, but that initial
download is brutal. Conversely, “code splitting” into tiny chunks made each chunk
easily-downloadable but code is almost certainly duplicated across those chunks and a user will be
paying for the same weight over and over again (🤔 not entirely unlike buying a home with cash or
paying it off over 30 years, now that I think about it).

With ESM, the entire dependency tree is exposed to the browser, so the browser can perfectly cache
what it needs, and nothing more. Of course, _cache invalidation_ is a separate problem that will be
with us until the end of time. But that aside, ESM truly is the perfect caching story for JS.

## making the switch

So let’s say you’re sold on ESM… how do you make the leap? Well, it may be your tools that are to
blame:

- **React:** doesn’t ship an ESM-ready package (as of [Mar 2020][esm-react])
- **npm:** `< 8%` of npm packages [ship ESM][esm-npm] (as of [Oct 2019][esm-npm])
- **Node.js:** though it supports ESM, it’s not in a stable LTS release yet (as of [Nov
  2019][esm-node])
- **webpack**: can’t ship your code as ESM, nor can it take advantage of ESM features like remote
  imports.

By choosing these tools even in new projects, you’re shipping legacy code that already has a limited
lifespan. But some of that isn’t within your control, sure—maybe your company, or client demands
these. Or you just can’t accomplish what you need to with alternatives; that’s understandable.

But there are also some new, exciting projects on the horizon that are shaping up to replace
now-legacy CommonJS tools:

### Snowpack

[Snowpack][snowpack] (a play on ”no pack”) is an install tool (disclosure: that I’m one of the [lead
contributers for][snowpack-contrib]) that lets you ship ESM-ready code straight to the browser
**and** use npm. You can `npm install` like normal, and lets you use Preact, Vue, Svelte, and more
but with **zero build time** and **no configuration.**

[snowpack.dev][snowpack]

### Pika CDN

[Pika Registry][pika-registry] does all the work of finding ESM-ready packages for you. Search for
any keyword like you would on npm, except Pika Registry can tell you instantly whether or not that
package supports ESM.

[pika.dev/registry][pika-registry]

### Deno

[Deno][deno] is a new competitor to Node.js, built with V8, Rust, and Tokio and features native
TypeScript and ESM support out-of-the-box. Its guiding principle is to more closely mirror
ECMAScript in the areas where Node departed, principally only allowing ESM rather than CommonJS.
Though the project is in beta, it’s already gathering community attention and shows tons of promise.

[deno.land][deno]

To recap, the current state of ESM in 2020 is: **it’s ready to use everywhere,** but **it’s up to
you to opt-in!** Give some of the new ESM tools a try, and you might find yourself dealing with less
tooling, less configuration, and other great benefits while helping the community at large unify
around ESM.
